      <p>The Gore Trout statue is a testament to Gores fishing culture.</p>
      <p>It shows how much Gore's citizens love for their fishing.</p>
      <p>This is also shown in the Welcome sign as it is right by the</p>
      <p>Trout statue. There are also many popular fishing spots as</p>
      <p>Gore has a large lake running through it meaning that if you</p>
      <p>go to the bridges its a great spot to fish.</p>
